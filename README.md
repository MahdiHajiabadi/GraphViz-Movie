# GraphViz-Movie

1. In the csv file there are three columns, the first column is source, the 2nd is target and the third could be interpreted as the time.
2. The code generates the static graph first and save it into the file which each node is in grey
3. For each new edge it make the endpoint nodes into red and if the nodes are in the longest path they turn into magenta
4. After creating all png static images, in the last step, it put them all together by OpenCV to create a movie (.avi) file. 

Please look at the project-mv.avi file as the example which shows the movie of multiverse-mx.csv. 

Please send me an email (XY@uvic.ca) if you have any questions. X is my first initial name and Y is my family name.
